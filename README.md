To run the project 

Step 1: First create the database and enter the name accordingly mentioned in the code itself.
Step 2: Download all the required libraries as per used in the codes.
Step 3: Run all the files accordingly from train.py to app.py.
Step 4: In this project we have used two servers for the back-end purpose.
Step 5: For the database we have used PhpMyAdmin for storing all the data.
Step 6: For running the Chatbot we have used the flask server.
Step 7: The app.py will provide the final server link using flask.
Step 8: For testing purpose you can use the testing1.py file just after the training it will provide you the graph and the Pass/Fail record in the terminal itself.

The Chatbot is using the tokenization technique.
The dataset used for the chatbot is the custom dataset created by ourself.
